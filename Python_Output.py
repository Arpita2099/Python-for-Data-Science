# While starting the code in the python just remember one thing that python is a case sensative language. So, keep in mind while using the syntax and function in the python.
# Now I am going to print something using the python. For instance,
print("Hey Everyone!, Welcome to python cosing language.")

#We acn also print anything in python using single inverted comma. For instance,
print('Okay, this is the code in python to print output using single inverted comma.')

# Also using the triple inverted comma we can print the output in the python. For instance, 
print('''
This is my first code in python using triple inverted comma.
Here, I can write myultiple sentence using this in the python at once.
And, it will give the output togethers.
''')
# Therefore, this is the about the python output using multiple inverted comma.

#Like above, we can also print the intege, boolen, and floats using the print common in the Python. For instance,
# For integer.
print(17) # It will provide you output 17.

#For Float
print(45.89) # It will provide you output 45.89.

# For Boolen,
print(True) # It is provide you value True.
print(False) # It will provide you output False.

# Even you can print multiple things at once. For instance,
print("Arpita is",True, 100, "%") # It will give you output Arpita is  True 100 %

# If you want to add anything rather than space in between above code then you can use below code.
print("Arpita is",True, 100, "%",) # It will give you output Arpita is /True/100/%
