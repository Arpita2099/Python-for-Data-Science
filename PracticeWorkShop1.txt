Once upon a time, there was a very curious cat and doting dog who lived together in a cozy house next to a meadow. The cat's name was Lulu and the dog's name was Duke.
Every night, Lulu and Duke would tell each other stories before they went to sleep, which they would conjure up with their imaginations.

One night, while they were snuggled up in bed together, Duke asked Lulu to tell him a story about cats and dogs living together in harmony.

Lulu thought for a moment before she began her story: "Once upon a time, there were two cats and two dogs who lived in the same house, but never talked to each other."

"One day," continued Lulu, "the cats decided that it was time for them to get to know the dogs better so they could all live together peacefully."

So the cats invited the dogs over for dinner and the four of them sat down at the table together for what seemed like an eternity of awkward silence until one of the cats broke it by asking the other cat what she had been up to lately.

This sparked an interesting conversation between all four animals that lasted until late into the night as they shared stories about their lives and interests with each other.

By the end of it, they had become good friends who truly appreciated one another's company - no matter what species they were!

From then on out, every night at bedtime Lulu and Duke would retell this story with variations between themselves until eventually it became part of their nightly ritual as a comforting reminder that two very different creatures can still live in harmony when given the chance to get to know one another better.

And so Lulu and Duke fell asleep every night knowing that if given the chance anyone can become friends no matter how different their backgrounds may be!
