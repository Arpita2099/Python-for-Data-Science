# Class can have two things 1. Data or property 2. Functions or behavior
# The data types like list, integer, float, dictionary, tuple, set are the built-in class in the python.
# Here, L is the Object and list is the Class.
# Class Basic Structure:
# class car:
#   color="blue" # data
#   model="sport" # data
#   def calculate_avg_speed(km,time):
#       color="blue" # data
#       model="sport" # data

L=[1,2,3]
print(type(L))

# Object: Object is an instance of the class.
# Object Examples
# 1. Car-----------> WagorR // wagonr=Cars()
# 2. Sports--------> Gilli Danda // gillidanda=Sports()
# 3. Animals-------> Langoor // langoor=Animals()

# Syntax to create an object
# Objectname=classname()

# Object Literal 
L=[1,2,3,4,5]
L=list()
print(L)

s=str()
print(s)
