# In python no need to declare variable like other programming langusge but you can give it when you are needed. For instance,
a=89
print(a)

s="Arpita Sah"
print(s)

# Way of writing the variable.
x=5
y=10
z=15
print(x,y,z)

# Second way of writing variable.
p,q,r=5,6,7
print(p,q,r)

# Variable can not be start by number, and special symbol except underscore_
# Also variable can not be declare using white space.
# Variable can not be in-built keywords.

# This is all about the variable in the python.
